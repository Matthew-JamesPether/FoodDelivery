# FoodDelivery

Developed a food delivery system using Java. Stores the uses name, email address, phone number, street address, restaurants name and location. Uses a text file to see if the restaurant location matches up with what the user has entered and displays the appropriate message. If the restaurant location matches the console prompt will then ask the user what they would like to order and asks the user for any additional instructions. Once entered the program will output a message saying an invoice was sent. The invoice is written to another text file which displays all the users details that they have entered as well as the total amount, the restaurants contact details, a order number and the name of the deliver who is in the area with the least amount of deliveries.
